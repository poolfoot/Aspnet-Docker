We are pleased to [announce](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/05/16/announcing-asp-net-core-rc2/) the release of ASP.NET Core RC2!

[Get started with ASP.NET Core RC2](https://docs.asp.net/en/1.0.0-rc2/getting-started.html)

If you are looking for the homepage of .NET Core, with getting started guides and downloads for released versions of ASP.NET Core then you should go to http://dot.net. This is the home page of our source code repositories and is intended for those contributing to ASP.NET Core or using bleeding edge nightly builds.

If you want a more stable, released, experience or getting started instructions then go to one of the following:

- [.NET Homepage](http://dot.net)
Check out dot.net for released versions of .NET, getting started guides, and learning resources.

- [ASP.NET Core Documentation](http://docs.asp.net) or [.NET Core Documentation](http://microsoft.com/net/core). We intend to merge these in the future.

If you want to follow along with development of ASP.NET Core then go to:

- [Community Standup](http://live.asp.net)
The community standup is held every week and streamed live to YouTube. You can view past standups in the linked playlist.
- [Roadmap](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Roadmap)
The schedule and milestone themes for ASP.NET Core.

## Getting ASP.NET Core

- Stable builds of ASP.NET Core should be obtained from http://dot.net.
- If you want to use nightlies then you need to:
    - Obtain the latest nightly CLI from http://github.com/dotnet/cli
    - Add a NuGet.Config to your app with the following content:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <packageSources>
            <clear />
            <add key="AspNetCI" value="https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetvnext/api/v3/index.json" />
            <add key="NuGet.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
        </packageSources>
    </configuration>
    ```
    *NOTE: This NuGet.Config should be with your application unless you want nightly packages to potentially start being restored for other apps on the machine.*
    - Change your applications dependencies to have a `*` to get the latest version, `1.0.0-*` for example.
